# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This application allows a user to enter a city. In return, the current weather is displayed along with a 5 day forecast.

A user may clear the current city if they choose, and enter a new one. When they do this, the past city they entered will display in a list under the search area.

If a user clicks on a past city, the weather will display for that city.
